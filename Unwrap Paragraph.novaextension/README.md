**Unwrap Paragraph** adds the ability to merge multiple lines of select text into one.

This is useful for combining multiple lines of data into one, or reflowing a paragraph of text that has had manual line breaks applied such as something pasted from an old email.

In _TextMate_ this command is called Unwrap Paragraph, which is why I've kept the same name.

## Usage

To run **Unwrap Paragraph**:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Unwrap Paragraph** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Unwrap Paragraph`
